INSTALLATION: 

      - Make sure you have an enviornment on your local machine that is able to compile and run C.
      - Open a new workspace and create two files:
          1. main.c (C source code file)
          2. words.txt (text file containing the whole dictionary)

RUNNING:

      - In order to run the program, I personally use and recommend the commond prompt "gcc FILENAME.c" to make and "./a.out" to compile
      - Once compiled, follow the instructions prompted by the program, press the "Enter" key to commit any input
