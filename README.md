INSTALLATION: 

      - Make sure you have an enviornment on your local machine that is able to compile and run C.
      - Open a new workspace and create two files, and copy and paste the content into them from the files above in which share the same name
          1. main.c (C source code file)
          2. words.txt (text file containing the whole dictionary)

RUNNING:

      - In order to run the program, I personally use and recommend the command prompt "gcc FILENAME.c" to compile and "./a.out" to run
      - Once running, follow the instructions prompted by the program, press the "Enter" key to commit any input
